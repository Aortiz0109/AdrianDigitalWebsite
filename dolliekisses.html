								About:
							</h3>
							<p class="project-list-style">
								This project came to me by a friend and former colleague who was starting a project establishing their own beauty, skincare, and candle line. Recognizing the need for professional design and branding assistance for their business I stepped in to provide support. Up until then, they had been crafting and producing products from the comfort of their home without the guidance of a formal designer for label creation or the establishment of a cohesive brand identity. Out of goodwill and as an opportunity to refine my skills in managing a comprehensive branding package, I contributed my expertise to elevate their company's visual presence.
							</p>
							<h3 class="project-desc-style">
								Challenges:
							</h3>
							<p class="myRoleDes">
								The primary challenges encountered during this project revolved around in investing time in researching the cosmetic industry and staying up-to-date of design trends across diverse products. This was essential to gain a nuanced understanding of what resonated with the target audience in the realms of skincare and beauty products. Additionally, while I was well-versed in creating book and print mockups, venturing into the realm of product design presented a unique set of design challenges. Furthermore, once the brand identity was agreed upon theres now an ongoing challenge in the design process for various labels and sizes across a spectrum of products.

						Brand Values and Personality:
					</h3>
					<p class="para1">
						In the initial phase of the project, I engaged in discussions with the client to discern their vision for the company and its products. My focus
						was on understanding the overall identity of the company, ensuring that the visual branding authentically represented its core ideas and values.
						While the client had not previously considered their products in this manner, we collaboratively delved into defining the target audience and
						constructing a brand identity that would resonate with them.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						The client had organically cultivated a consumer base primarily through word of mouth, reaching friends, family, and coworkers. This demographic 
						comprised predominantly adult women residing in urban areas, and indicated a clientele with financial means to invest in the products. Their preference
						leaned towards items associated with concepts such as self-care, relaxation, coupled with a positive reception towards the clients entrepreneurial spirit.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						From from the initial conversation, we established core values, including Inclusivity, Community, Quality, Self-care, and Sustainability. This 
						foundation guided the formulation of a brand personality aligning with these values, with descriptors such as Luxury, Creative, Empowering, and Urban 
						chosen to encapsulate the essence of the company. This strategic approach aimed not only to reflect the company's values but also to establish a 
						strong connection with its diverse customer base.

				<div class="work-flow-table"> <!-- Client Mood Board -->
					<h3 class="workflow-title lefttab">
						Client Mood Board:
					</h3>
					<p class="para1">
						Following the initial conversation with the client, I assigned them the task of exploring Pinterest and advertisements to gather inspiration for products, 
						colors, fonts, and imagery that resonated with them and reflected the established brand personality. From the compiled visuals, I curated a mood board 
						that served as a foundational source of inspiration for shaping the visual identity of the Dollie Kisses brand.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						This exercise proved to be mutually beneficial, as it not only guided the client in articulating their preferences but also provided me with valuable 
						insights. As someone relatively new to conceptualizing product designs for items such as cosmetics, candles, and sugar scrubs, delving into the client's 
						mood board allowed me to explore the market landscape. I dedicated time to researching existing products, visiting websites, and gathering ideas on how 
						other companies effectively marketed similar items.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						In both my research and the client's mood board, a recurring theme emerged: the use of neutral palettes with strategic focal points, employing either a primary 
						color or bold font to draw attention. Recognizing the effectiveness of this approach in maintaining a balance between visual appeal and simplicity, I integrated 
						these insights into the preliminary themes for the Dollie Kisses brand. The goal was to create products that felt elegantly designed yet retained a soft and 
						approachable aesthetic for a more comfortable consumer experience.

					<h3 class="workflow-title lefttab">
						Building Brand Colors:
					</h3>
					<p class="para1">	
						From the client's mood board, I derived a selection of sample colors for the Dollie Kisses brand, encompassing a spectrum of neutral pinks and beiges, 
						as well as vibrant pop colors like purple, orange, and red. Notably, the poppy purple from a brand ad pack stood out to both the client and me. Its 
						uniqueness appealed to the client, who appreciated the rarity of purple as a focal color in the cosmetic industry. Purple, with its connotations of 
						luxury and creativity, aligned seamlessly with the brand personality we had earlier defined.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						To refine the chosen purple into a hue that better suited the envisioned brand identity—one that exuded sophistication rather than youthful exuberance—I 
						desaturated the color and introduced more red to the hue. This adjustment resulted in a rich plum color, aptly named "Palatinate" (#681759), serving as 
						the primary brand color. To complement this, I opted for a darker purple (#26021B) as a substitute for plain black in design, ensuring harmony within 
						the color palette.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						In addition to the primary purple colors, I carefully selected accent colors to enhance the brand's visual appeal. A luxurious gold hue (#FFD20A) was 
						chosen to complement the plum color and evoke a sense of wealth. Another warm red, termed "Bittersweet" (#FE504F), served as a dynamic pop color in 
						advertisements while harmonizing with the plum shade.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						For packaging, I sought a neutral color inspired by the pinks and beiges prevalent in other products. Drawing inspiration from precious metals, I 
						settled on a desaturated rose gold color named "Pale Dogwood" (#E0BFB8) to create an elegant and neutral tone suitable for packaging. This 
						comprehensive color palette was curated to encapsulate the essence of Dollie Kisses and resonate with its target audience.
					</p>

				<div class="work-flow-table"> <!-- The Font -->
					<h3 class="workflow-title lefttab">
						Selecting a Font:
					</h3>
					<p class="para1">
						Selecting a suitable font for the Dollie Kisses logo proved to be a meticulous process involving careful consideration and elimination. The inherent 
						challenge lay in balancing the naturally youthful feel of the brand name with the desire to appeal to an adult audience. I explored various options, 
						including serif fonts like Playfair, Lora, and Baskerville, as well as sans-serif fonts like Proxima Nova and Seravek. Additionally, I experimented 
						with uppercase letters, small caps, and lowercase forms to assess their impact.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						It became evident that pushing against the inherent youthful nature of the phrase "Dollie Kisses" with skinny delicate fonts and decorative serifs 
						clashed with the brand expression. Similarly, modern fonts risked diluting the character of the expression, resulting in a generic appearance. A 
						particular challenge arose with the capital "D" in "Dollie," which seemed to conflict with the brand's essence, especially when stacking words for 
						a vertical logo.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						The solution emerged in keeping the logo in lowercase, a choice that naturally softened the word and aligned with the playful and approachable nature 
						of "dollie." To achieve visual impact without compromising on the brand's personality, I leaned towards the Lora Bold font. This font struck a balance 
						between modernity and well-balanced aesthetics, with calligraphic details in the serifs adding visual interest. Considering the established brand 
						identity—with a color palette conveying a luxurious and creative vibe—I felt that the Lora Bold font injected an urban and empowered personality into 
						the logo. This thoughtful alignment of font and brand traits resulted in a logo that I believed effectively represented Dollie Kisses in its entirety.

				<div class="work-flow-table"> <!-- Designing the Logo -->
					<h3 class="workflow-title lefttab">
						Designing the Logo:
					</h3>
					<p class="para1">
						The client's initial request was to incorporate lips into the logo, as this imagery had been associated with their products since the inception of 
						their business. While honoring this preference, I aimed to create a unique and timeless lips logo that could serve as a distinctive symbol for their 
						brand in the long term.
					</p>
					<p class="para-subheader"><span class="bold-word">3 Color Logo - Horizontal </span></p>
					<p class="para2">
						The first iteration presented a more detailed design, utilizing three colors to portray a realistic pair of lips. This design closely mirrored the 
						original photograph used for a logo but was strategically simplified for ease of printing and versatile design application.
					</p>
					<p class="para-subheader"><span class="bold-word">1 Color Logo - Horizontal and Stacked</span></p>
					<p class="para2">
						Upon laying out the three-color design, I proposed a refined version—a single-color flat icon logo. I advocated for this concept due to its clean and 
						timeless quality, inspired by the iconic logos of renowned brands like Apple, Starbucks, and McDonald's. To emphasize the versatility and widespread 
						use of one-color logos, I showcased a compilation of luxury brands employing this approach.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						The final one-color design featured a stylized lip icon with a unique heart-shaped pattern at the center. This carefully crafted and iconic logo was 
						envisioned to seamlessly tie the brand together. Its simplicity and adaptability made it well-suited for placement on a variety of products, accommodating 
						the diverse shapes and containers a small cosmetics business might employ. This design decision ensured a consistent and unified symbol for the Dollie 
						Kisses brand, irrespective of the packaging variations necessitated by the business's scale at different stages of growth.

						Mockups:
					</h3>
					<p class="para1">
						Recognizing that the Dollie Kisses brand operates as a small business primarily requiring stickers and labels instead of fully packaged products, I 
						aimed to demonstrate the brand's potential to the client. To convey this vision effectively, I crafted future product mockups that showcased how the 
						brand's identity could be seamlessly integrated into professional packaging that would be seen on a store shelf.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						These mockups were designed strategically, emphasizing the power of a minimalistic approach. By employing just a few carefully chosen colors, utilizing 
						two distinct fonts, and featuring the simple yet impactful logo, the mockups illustrated the versatility and cohesiveness achievable across an entire 
						catalog of products. The intention was to convey to the client that even with limited elements, a robust brand identity could be established, fostering 
						a cohesive and visually appealing presence on store shelves.
					</p>
					<p class="para2">
						In essence, these product mockups served as a persuasive tool, illustrating the potential for a unified and striking brand image across a variety of 
						products, reinforcing the notion that simplicity and consistency can go a long way in creating a strong visual impact for Dollie Kisses.
